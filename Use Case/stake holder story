Stakeholder Stories:
The user login interface has a high priority as a stakeholder. I want there to be a
username and password to access the account so that Iâ€™m able to control the thing to sell.
The contact page has a high priority as a stakeholder because having a good customer
relationship is a necessity for a good business. Customers should be able to easily reach us out
through phone or email.
As a stakeholder, the billing and shipping function has a high priority. I want the process
of check out for the customer to be very easy. This is an online business and I want the
customer to have a happy experience purchasing. Shipping input functionality is required so the
item can be easily mailed to the customer after being purchased.
As a stakeholder, customer review and feedback are has a priority because we would
like to know how the customer feels about our product so we can improve and grow.
